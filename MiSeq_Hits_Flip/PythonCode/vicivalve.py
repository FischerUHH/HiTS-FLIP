VICI valve controller class

This file contains a class for controlling various VICI valve. They are connected to the PC through either RS232 or USB
as virtual COM port. Communication is achieved through sending ASCII strings.

    This is a basic driver class for the VICI Valco Universal Electric Actuator. At the moment it only implements a
    subset of all available commands based on the most common needs. It works with both the USB and the RS232/485
    variety, as long as an FTDI converter is used.

    To use a VICI valve, creat an instance of the VICI class and pass it a Serial object fo the connection:
    >>> serial = Serial(baudrate=9600)
    >>> valve = VICI(serial)

    If RS485 is used AND all valves on one line have individual addresses, multiple VICI instances can use the same
    Serial object. In that case, an address must be passed:
    >>> valve1 = VICI(serial=serial, address=1)
    >>> valve2 = VICI(serial=serial, address=2)

    After installing a new valve head, the actuator needs to "learn" the end stops in order to properly switch the
    valve:
    >>> valve.learn()

    The valve can be homed (sent to position A or 1), switched to a position (A or B, or 0-n where n is the number of
    positions), or toggled:
    >>> valve.home()  # sends the valve to position A or 1
    >>> valve.switch_valve("B")  # sends the valve to position B
    >>> valve.switch_valve(1)  # sends the valve back to position A, using an integer as argument
    >>> valve.toggle()  # sends the valve to position B, since it was in A before
    >>> valve.toggle()  # sends the valve back to position A
