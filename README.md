# HiTS-FLIP
'High-throughput sequencingâ€“fluorescent ligand interaction profiling' (HiTS-FLIP) is an experiment that enables the study of target-molecules with millions of varying DNA-sequences in parallel on a fow cell of next-generation sequencers - in this case Illumina's MiSeq.

In the corresponding publication we present two different ways of examining the interactions between target-molecule and DNA, 
## 1. Additional external valve 
The experiment can be carried out by connecting an external valve to port 23 of the internal valve and controlling it via USB. By adding specific wait-times to the recipe `HiTS_FLIP_RECIPE`, in which the execution of the sequencers main program pauses, the switching of the valve can be triggered as a custom python script reads out the `log`-files which are generated as the routine proceeds. This approach is recommended for setups which require larger amounts of reagents than 3 mL and enables the user to execute the sequencing and interaction profiling in one step with minimal hands-on time. 
## 2. Without modification of the Hardware
The second approach solely  uses the internal valve of the MiSeq subsequent to a "regular" proprietary sequencing. For this method, a used cartridge of the previous sequencing run has to be customized by removing the RFID and the clear top cover. After cleaning the contained tubes carefully they can be filled with custom solutions of the desired target molecule in the corresponding buffer. The Process can be started by removing the used RFIDs from the other used consumables and holding the RFIDs of a new kit against the DFID-sensors during setup. The "new" RFIDs are not corrupted by this process and can be used regularly later on.
Despite the requirement for an additional working-step this setup comes with integrated  cooling and a lower consumption of target-solution therefore enabling the measurement of triplicates.

## Software Requirements
### MiSeq Control Software 
### External Valve
For the use of an external valve python 3.8 was installed on the MiSeq along with the folling packages:
- `VICI`
- `ftdi_serial`
- `pandas`

### Data Extractrion
Data extraction from `cif`,`loc` and`fastq`-files was performed using python 3.11 utilizing the following packages:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`


# Installation Guide
## HiTS-FLIP with external valve
If using an external valve, install python and copy the folder `MiSeq_Hits_Flip` to `C:\` of your MiSeq. Also install the drivers for the valve. Afterwards make the alias `sv [pos]`accessible by typing 
`reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v Autorun /d "doskey /macrofile=\"C:\MiSeq_Hits_Flip\BatchFiles\Makros.doskey\"" /f`
into the terminal on the sequencer. 
Make a copy your `Amplicon` recipe from `D:\Illumina\MiSeq Control Software\CustomRecipe\` and add the lines supplied in `HiTS_FLIP_RECIPE_ADDITION`.

## HiTS-FLIP from custom filled cartride
Copy `FLIP_RECIPE` to `D:\Illumina\MiSeq Control Software\CustomRecipe\`
